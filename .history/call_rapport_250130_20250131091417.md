**Action Wall Report: AI Builders Community Model Training Initiative**  
*Date: [Insert Date]*  

---

### **üéØ Objective**  
Explore the feasibility of training/fine-tuning an open-source LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) for domain-specific reasoning and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications. Define roles, resources, and next steps.  

---

### **üìã Key Discussion Points**  
1. **Project Vision**  
   - Focus on **domain-specific reasoning models** to enhance RAG systems (e.g., technical manuals, telecom, or industrial use cases).  
   - Potential to create a model that self-improves via reinforcement learning or distillation.  
   - Open-source collaboration to address the lack of European/Dutch-centric models.  

2. **Technical Directions**  
   - **Fine-tuning vs. Distillation**: Prioritize fine-tuning existing reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek) for RAG optimization.  
   - **Hybrid RAG + Knowledge Graphs**: Explore combining RAG with knowledge graphs for better retrieval accuracy.  

3. **Challenges**  
   - Rapid obsolescence of models (e.g., "outdated in weeks").  
   - Need for specialized infrastructure (GPUs, cloud credits).  

4. **Next Steps**  
   - **GitHub Repository**: Amr to set up a collaborative space for documentation and code.  
   - **Use Case Validation**: Engage with organizations (e.g., Fausto‚Äôs consulting project with industrial companies) to define pilot applications.  
   - **Community Outreach**: Share findings in the AI Builders Club and recruit additional contributors.

### **‚ùì Open Questions (Requiring Further Research)**  

#### **Technical**  
1. How to implement **reinforcement learning** for self-improving reasoning models?  
   - Can ambivalence detection in model outputs be automated for RAG feedback loops?  
2. What data structures (e.g., knowledge graphs) optimize retrieval for domain-specific RAG?  
3. How to adapt DeepSeek‚Äôs reasoning process for specialized domains without access to its training methodology?  

#### **Infrastructure & Resources**  
4. What GPU/cloud resources are available?  
   - Can members access/sponsor A100/H100 clusters or cloud credits (Lambda, Hugging Face)?  
5. Cost estimates for fine-tuning vs. training a distilled model (e.g., 7B parameter version).  

#### **Project Scope**  
6. Should the project prioritize a **multilingual** or **single-language** model?  
7. Legal/ethical risks of training on proprietary data (e.g., technical manuals)?  
8. How to validate the business value of a domain-specific reasoning model vs. commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic)?
